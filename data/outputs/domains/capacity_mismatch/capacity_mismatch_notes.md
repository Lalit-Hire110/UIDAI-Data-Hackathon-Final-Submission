# Capacity Mismatch Domain - Figure Notes
Analyzes population vs activity imbalances (descriptive only).

## Figures
1. **Mismatch Scatter**: Shows relationship between population and activity, colored by mismatch type
2. **Type Distribution**: Count of pincodes in each category (low/balanced/high activity)
3. **Magnitude Histogram**: Distribution of mismatch magnitudes

## Metrics
- **capacity_utilization_percentile**: National ranking of activity rate
- **mismatch_type**: high_activity (>75th percentile), low_activity (<25th), balanced
- **mismatch_magnitude**: Deviation from expected activity level
